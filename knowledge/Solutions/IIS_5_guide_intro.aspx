 <H2>Security guide for IIS 5.0 (without .Net framework)</H2>	
 
 <blockquote>
   <p>After careful research and extensive testing in our labs, we found 
   solutions for the mentioned security vulnerabilities. <br>
   <br>
   This guide provides technical solutions, methodologies and a STEP-BY-STEP 
   explanation on how to build secure IIS 5.0 servers. <br>
   <br>
   The aim of this security guide is to help ISPs and IIS administrators to 
   secure their servers.<br>
   <br>
   Because the guide contains code that allows the exploitation of the security 
   vulnerabilities, we are very cautious about controlling circulation and 
   initially, only intend releasing the guide to named security contacts within 
   ISPs and a limited number of corporates that manage IIS 5.0 servers within 
   their organization<br>
   <br>
