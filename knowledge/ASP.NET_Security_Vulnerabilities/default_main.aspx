 <H2>Asp.Net security vulnerabilities</H2>
 
 <blockquote>
   <p>This section contains research done by DDPlus IT security consultants 
   while working on the 2003 / IIS 6.0 version of the security guide “Secure 
   Shared hosting with IIS 5.0” also published by DDPlus.<br>
   <br>
   As with the previous guide the focus is on Shared Hosting environments which 
   are there ones that have the most demanding and complicated security 
   requirements<br>
   <br>
   Since ASP.NET is such a new technology, in order to be effectively defending 
   it, one must know what are the existent real or potential problems / 
   vulnerabilities. <br>
   <br>
   This section&nbsp; is still in draft mode and aims to start a debate in the 
   security community about the issues presented.<br>
   <br>
   We welcome feedback, comments, suggestions and corrections to the content 
   (send Emails to Security.Guides@ddplus.co.uk)<br>
