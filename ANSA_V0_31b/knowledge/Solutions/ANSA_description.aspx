 <H2>ANSA - description</H2>	
 
 <blockquote>
   <p>Asp.Net Security Analyser (ANSA) is a Windows based online tool that tests 
   the server's security for known security vulnerabilities. The tool was 
   designed to allow the protection of ISPs providing shared hosting services.<br>
   <br>
   This project's objective is to create an Open Source tool to allow system 
   administrators (responsible for windows based shared hosting environments) to 
   easily identify their current security vulnerabilities.<br>
   <br>
   The current version is focused on identifying the security vulnerabilities 
   such as: remote command execution, pour website isolation (i.e. the user from 
   website A can see the data from website B), disclosure of sensitive 
   information (such as usernames/passwords, running processes, installed 
   services), ability to do a server based port scan, etc...<br>
   <br>
   The plan is to (with time) evolve to a system administration tool that not 
   only identifies the problems but also helps the system administrator to 
   correct them.<br>
   <br>
   Thanks for your time, and don't hesitate to contact me if you require any 
   further information.</p>
